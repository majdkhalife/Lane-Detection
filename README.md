# Real-Time Lane Detection Pipeline for Autonomous Driving using Classical Computer Vision 

I've been interested in AVs for quite some time, and I want to learn more about a simple method to monitor whether or not cars are staying in their lane using traditional CV methods, and avoiding the usage of the very powerful, but **expensive** GPUs.
I plan on processing live video from a road, identify lane regions, detect edges, keypoints, apply Hough Transforms to get lane lines and visualize it in real time.
